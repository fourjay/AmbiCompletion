Description:
  This script provides an ambiguous completion functionality.
  For those who are forgetful.

  This is a fork of Word Fuzzy Completion.
  (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3857)

  THIS IS BETA QUALITY.

Usage:
  Set completefunc to g:AmbiCompletion.

  like :set completefunc=g:AmbiCompletion

Variables:

  (A right hand side value is a default value.)

  g:AmbiCompletion_richerSupportForMultibyte = 1
      (obsolete in the future, recher only)

      gives up completion using Python (even though you have +python),
      and enables richer extraction of multibyte characters.

          0: x10 quicker and poorer multibyte support. NOT TESTED WELL
          1: Richer multibyte support.

  g:AmbiCompletion_allBuffers = 0
      (obsolete in the future)

      decides from where to collect word samples.

          0: Collects from only in the current buffer.
          1: Collects from all over the buffers.

      Note this value is ignored when recher support for multibyte is enabled.

  g:AmbiCompletion_cacheCheckpoint = 10

      cache-updating interval.
      The cache is updated when undo sequence progresses by this value.

Commands:
  
  AmbiCompletionRefreshCache

      updates the cache immediately.
