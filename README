Description:
  This script provides an ambiguous completion functionality.
  For those who are forgetful.

  This script completes a word with not only starts-with match but also ends-with and contains match.

  This is a fork of Word Fuzzy Completion.
  vimscript #3857

  THIS IS ALPHA QUALITY.

Usage:
  Set completefunc to g:AmbiCompletion.

  like :set completefunc=g:AmbiCompletion

  If you have +python, you will get more speed.

Variables:

  (A right hand side value is a default value.)

  g:AmbiCompletion_richerSupportForMultibyte = 0
      gives up completion using Python (even though you have +python),
      and enables richer extraction of multibyte characters.

          0: Quicker and poorer multibyte support.
          1: x10 Slower and richer multibyte support.

  g:AmbiCompletion_allBuffers = 0
      decides from where to collect word samples.

          0: Collects from only in the current buffer.
          1: Collects from all over the buffers.

      Note this value is ignored when recher support for multibyte is enabled.
